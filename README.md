# DFC - Data Fitness Connector

Free your data! 

DFC allows the Peloton Bike to communicate with fitness watches, head units, and apps — a feature that’s not available on the stock Bikes. It reads power and cadence data in real-time, through a cable connected to your bike, and broadcasts them wirelessly to nearby devices including those built around platforms like Zwift and Garmin. This lets you enjoy the built-in functionality of your bike while simultaneously utilizing features and services that depend on third-party platforms.

* Supports two simultaneous wireless connections for connecting to both a wearable and app at the same time
* Wireless device firmware updates for future upgrades
* Open and expandable platform for adding new features down the line

# DFC - Data Fitness Connector

Free your data! DFC retransmits the power and cadence data from a Peloton bike wirelessly so you can decide what to do with your data.

The DFC data broadcaster is a Bluetooth device that allows Peloton bikes to connect to fitness watches, bike head units, and apps. This is a feature that's not available on the stock bike. In real-time it reads data on a cable from your indoor bike and broadcasts power and cadence data wirelessly to other platforms like Zwift and Garmin. This allows the simultaneous use of services from other platforms in addition the service offerings of the bike.
